## Special configuration when using Spring

By default, Vaadin Flow only includes ```com/vaadin/flow/component``` to be always scanned for UI components and views. For this reason, the addon might need to be whitelisted in order to display correctly. 

To do so, just add ```com.flowingcode``` to the ```vaadin.whitelisted-packages``` property in ```src/main/resources/application.properties```, like:

```vaadin.whitelisted-packages = com.vaadin,org.vaadin,dev.hilla,com.flowingcode```
 
More information on Spring whitelisted configuration [here](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/integrations/spring/configuration/#configure-the-scanning-of-packages).
